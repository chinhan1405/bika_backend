"""Views for healthcheck endpoints.

Disable atomic requests, because when `ATOMIC_REQUEST=True` django would
still go to db to check the state, meaning there would an error when db is
not available.

Note: these endpoints are still dependant on db, if you logged in via browser,
or in other words have session cookies.
